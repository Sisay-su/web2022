      <p>Regular exercise and physical activity are the keys to good health and
      happiness. Exercising burns fat, builds muscle, lowers cholesterol,
      reduces  stress and anxiety, and allows us to sleep soundly. We match
      resources and nutrition that are critical to your exercise needs at every
      fitness level in this guide.</p>

      <p>Regular physical activity can improve your muscle strength and boost
        your endurance. Exercise delivers oxygen and nutrients to your tissues
        and helps your cardiovascular system work more efficiently. And when
        your heart and lung health improve, you have more energy to tackle
        daily chores.</P>
